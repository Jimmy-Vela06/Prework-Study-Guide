# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A studgy guide to the pre-work

As a student in enrolled in the SMU Bootcamp for coding I created this web page to prepair myself for the course by creating a "Prework Study Guide Webpage". I build this page using basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This allowed me to creat an HTML file that i can access to study the pre work material. In doing so I learned fundementals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aswell as learned about Github and how to create a ripository.
